This is a Simple ToDoList App that stores all the information saved in UserDefaults that in Swift is a simple and lightweight persistence mechanism used to store small amounts of data such as user preferences and settings. It is essentially a key-value store that allows you to save and retrieve simple data types.
This project is done just for learning purpose. Still, I suggest you to check this out and give feedbacks on it if you have one.
